CROCO coupling tools
--------------------
Coupling_tools are provided to help building coupled configuration with CROCO, WRF, and WW3.

Organization
------------
Tools are divided into preprocessing and run tools. 
Preprocessing tools are provided in the croco_tools repository. 
Tools to run the coupled configuration are provided in the CROCO sources repository.
 
- croco_tools/Coupling_tools
- croco/SCRIPTS/SCRIPTS_COUPLING

Summary of steps for building a coupled configuration
-----------------------------------------------------
1. Get source codes
2. Compile OASIS
3. Compile your models in coupled mode (with the same netcdf libraries and compilers, NB: CROCO can alternatively be compiled when launching the run within the coupling toolbox)
4. Set-up your configuration architecture and environment using: croco/create_config.bash (all-prod-cpl option)
5. Perform pre-processing for your different models
6. Use the coupling toolbox to set-up and run your coupled configuration

Coupling toolbox philosophy and workflow:

  - The user edit:
      * myenv_mypath.sh : environment settings, and paths
      * mynamelist.sh   : settings for the experiment (which models, time stepping, input filesâ€¦)
      * myjob.sh        : settings for the job (dates notably)

  - Then the user launch the job with ./submitjob.sh

The coupling toolbox manages:  

  - CROCO compilation if requested
  - getting models input files
  - preparing OASIS restart files
  - editing namelists (for models and OASIS)
  - launching the run
  - putting output files
  - eventually looping for another job

The usual configuration architecture is: 

HOMEDIR/CONFIGS/MY_CONFIF_NAME
             create_config.bash.bck
             myenv_mypath.sh
             mynamelist.sh
             myjob.sh
             submitjob.sh
